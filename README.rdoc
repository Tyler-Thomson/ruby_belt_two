== Shoe Marketplace

This is a RoR app I made while learning Ruby(and Rails). Users can be buyers or sellers, and can make transactions with each other. Once a pair of shoes is listed, it can be bought, and will subsequently be taken off of the available shoes listings, and added to the purchase history of the buyer, and the sold history of the seller.
